# Titanic
Machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
To do so, it was essential to clean the data and analyse it visually through several graphics using the Seaborn and MatPlotLib libraries alongside with Numpy and Pandas.
As far as it concerns the prediction, it was used the Sklearn library. Through it, it was possible to use different techniques, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, Bagging, Gradient Boost and more.
